eQ-3/ELV MAX! Cube Python API |Build Status| |Coverage Status|
=============================

A python api to control the Max! Cube thermostats:

- get basic info about the cube itself
- get info about the max thermostats connected to the cube (mode, temperatures ...)

Basic usage:

.. code:: python

    from maxcube.cube import MaxCube
    from maxcube.connection import MaxCubeConnection

    cube = MaxCube(MaxCubeConnection('192.168.0.20', 62910))

    for device in cube.devices:
        print(device.name)
        print(device.actual_temperature)

This api was build for the integration of the Max! thermostats into `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`__ and
does only cover the functions needed for the integration.
